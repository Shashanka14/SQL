-- Data Wrangling: This is the first step, where data is inspected.
-- Build a database
-- Create a table and insert the data.
-- There are no null values in our database, as we set NOT NULL for each field when creating the tables, thereby filtering out null values.

-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS walmartSales;


-- Create table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales(
	invoice_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,

-- Feature Engineering: This will help us generate some new columns from existing ones.
